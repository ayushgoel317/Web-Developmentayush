            <p>Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us would reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website attractive and user-friendly. 
                The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of front-end development, and no, 
                it is not as easy as it seems!</p>
                <p>However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in 
                    front-end design and web development.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Commenting</h4></li>
                        <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and
                             understand where things are at and how they work.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Invest In Productive Tools.</h4>
                            <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser 
                                add-ons to smart plugins, the amount of choices available now is massive! So, 
                                why not invest in some really productive web tools that’ll help you 
                                improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, 
                                Emmet, Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.

A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful 
                                learning sources for front-end developers -

                            <ul>

                                <li>SQL</li>

                            </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            <p>
                                By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality. 
                                This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it, 
                                your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before. 
                                Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it
                                 ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.
